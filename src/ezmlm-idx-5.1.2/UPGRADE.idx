Like any other piece of software (and information generally), ezmlm-idx
comes with NO WARRANTY.

This file is for upgrading from earlier version of ezmlm-idx/mod. If you use
ezmlm-0.53 but have not installed a previous version of ezmlm-idx,
see INSTALL.idx. For details on what's new in this version, see CHANGES.idx.

1. Proceed as per INSTALL.idx.
   NOTE: If you follow the test instructions in INSTALL of ezmlm-0.53 after
   adding ezmlm-idx, step 6 will fail. Before this step, edit
   ~/testlist/editor and remove the ezmlm-reject line. 


Steps required for upgrading from ezmlm-idx-0.31x/32x
-----------------------------------------------------
In the unlikely event that you have lists that have been manually configured
to use ezmlm-gate (sender check/moderation combination) using only a single
directory, add the same directory to the command line a second time. If you
do not do this, all messages will be moderated, i.e. no major problem. No
other changes are required, but you may want to use some of the new features
(see CHANGES.idx).

See below to migrate customized ezmlmrc files.

Run ezmlm-idx on your lists. The index file format has changed. The old
format will still work, but only the new format can be used with WWW archive
access.

To enable WWW archive access for your list(s) see the "Optional" section in
INSTALL.idx.

If you used MySQL support, you need to update the tables. A few new fields
have been added for performance moitoring and billing. sub_mysql/to40x will
generate the necessary SQL. For each list, do:

sh sub_mysql/to40x list | mysql ...

where ``list'' is the tableroot for the list.

Additional steps for upgrading from ezmlm-idx-0.30x
---------------------------------------------------

If your old lists use SENDER restriction on posts with aliases (DIR/extra)
and blacklisted addresses (DIR/blacklist) you need to change the name of
these directories to DIR/allow and DIR/deny, respectively, and rebuild the list
(see below). Without this change the list will still function normally, but
addresses cannot be added/removed from these addresses remotely (e.g. via
list-allow-subscribe). Other than this, your lists will function without
modifications if you are upgrading from ezmlm-idx>=0.30.

See below for changing the names of the extra databases.


Additional steps for upgrading from ezmlm-idx<0.30
--------------------------------------------------
1.  Reindex the subject index for existing lists:

	% ezmlm-idx DIR

    for each list directory 'DIR'.

2.  For existing digest lists, assuming the list "joe-sos" and the digest list
    "joe-sos-digest".

    a. Remove links to the digest list:

	% rm -f ~joe/.qmail-sos-digest*

    b. edit the main list to include a digest list:

	% ezmlm-make -edxxx ~joe/SOS ~joe/.qmail joe-sos id.com gaga

       where 'xxx' are switches used in creating the original list. For lists
       created with ezmlm-idx-0.23 or later, the arguments after the list
       directory may be omitted.

    c. Move the digest subscriber info:

	% mv ~joe/SOS-digest/subscribers/* ~joe/SOS/digest/subscribers

    The digest list bounce info will be lost, as the key used for the new
    digest is the same as for the list, and different for that from the old
    digest. At worst, this will make the info for a digest user on missed
    digests incomplete. It may also slightly delay the removal
    of a permanently bouncing subscriber addresses.


Additional steps for upgrading from ezmlm-idx<0.23x
---------------------------------------------------
For subscription-moderated lists created with ezmlm-idx<0.23:

1.  If you have subscription moderated lists created with ezmlm-idx<0.23,
    they likely lack dir/text/mod-sub-confirm and dir/text/mod-unsub-confirm.
    Ezmlm-idx-0.23 substituted dir/text/(un)sub-confirm if the above files were
    missing, but ezmlm-idx>=0.30 will not work without these files. Again,
    ezmlm-make -e is the easiest way to update the list. Alternatively,
    just copy dir/text/(un)sub-confirm to dir/text/mod-(un)sub-confirm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's it! To report success (this helps to track platform-specific problems):

       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
         | mail idxtracker@ezmlm.org

Replace First M. Last with your name.

Send bugs reports, ideally with patch, to 'bruceg@em.ca'.

Migrating customized ezmlmrc files
==================================

ezmlmrc is upgraded from ezmlm-idx-0.31x/32x, but the changes are not required
for using the list.

The changes from ezmlm-0.30x are minimal, but fix a couple of bugs, see
CHANGES.idx). If you have custom ezmlmrc files and wish to update them,
do the following:

    First create a diff between the old ezmlmrc distribution and the
    custom ezmlmrc file:

	% cp /usr/local/bin/ezmlm/ezmlmrc ~/ezmlmrc.orig
	% cp ~/.ezmlmrc ~/ezmlmrc
	% diff -c ~/ezmlmrc.orig ~/ezmlmrc ~/ezmlmrc.diff

    Next, apply the changes to the new ezmlmrc:

	% cp .../ezmlm-idx-0.33/ezmlmrc ~/ezmlmrc
	% patch ~/ezmlmrc < ~/ezmlmrc.diff

    Next check for rejected parts (you need to apply them manually):

	% cat ~/ezmlmrc.rej

Any existing list can be edited with 'ezmlm-make -e dir dot local host [code]'
with the appropriate switches to take advantage of new ezmlm functions. If
you make ezmlmrc files in other languages, please make them public domain and
mail them to bruceg@em.ca for inclusion in future versions of ezmlm-idx.

Adjusting the name of the extra databases (from ezmlm-idx<0.30):
===============================================================

	% mv DIR/extra DIR/allow
	% mv DIR/blacklist DIR/deny
	% ezmlm-make -+ DIR

Additional steps required when upgrading from ezmlm-idx<0.30:

1.  Reindex the subject index for existing lists:

	% ezmlm-idx DIR

    for each list directory 'DIR'.

2.  For existing digest lists, assuming the list "joe-sos" and the digest list
    "joe-sos-digest".

    a. Remove links to the digest list:

	% rm -f ~joe/.qmail-sos-digest*

    b. edit the main list to include a digest list:

	% ezmlm-make -edxxx ~joe/SOS ~joe/.qmail joe-sos id.com gaga

       where 'xxx' are switches used in creating the original list. For lists
       created with ezmlm-idx-0.23 or later, the arguments after the list
       directory may be omitted.

    c. Move the digest subscriber info:

	% mv ~joe/SOS-digest/subscribers/* ~joe/SOS/digest/subscribers

    The digest list bounce info will be lost, as the key used for the new
    digest is the same as for the list, and different for that from the old
    digest. At worst, this will make the info for a digest user on missed
    digests incomplete. It may also slightly delay the removal
    of a permanently bouncing subscriber addresses.
