.SH NAME
ezmlm-issubn \- test to see if an address is subscribed to a mailing list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezmlm-issubn
[
.B \-nN
]
.I dir
.I [ dir1 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezmlm-issubn
checks to see if the address obtained from the environment variable
.I SENDER
is subscribed to the mailing list stored in
.I dir 
or the mailing list in
.I dir1 
or ...

If
.I SENDER
is not defined
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits with an error.

If
.I SENDER
is on [any of] the mailing list[s],
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits with a zero exit code.

If
.I box\fB@\fIdomain
is not on the mailing list,
.B ezmlm-issubn
exits 99. This exit code is non-success from a shell point of view, but to
qmail it means "success and skip remaining lines in the .qmail file). Thus,
a simple way to execute a delivery if the
.ezmlm-issubn
criteria are met is to place the
.B ezmlm-issubn
line first, followed by the action line. If SENDER is a subscriber, the
action line is executed, if not, the line is ignored without the generation
of an error condition. To generate a fatal error, just:

.EX
|/path/ezmlm-issubn
.I dir ...
|| (echo "err msg"; exit 100)

|/path/action_for_subscribers
|/path/more_for_subscribers
.EE

If
.I dir1
(or more) are present on the command line and are relative paths,
.B ezmlm-issubn
only examines the named subdirectories within the preceding absolute
path
.IR dir .

.B ezmlm-issubn
exits 100 on permanent and 111 on temporary errors.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Negate exit code. Exit 99 if SENDER is a subscriber and exit 0 if not.
This is useful when trying to exclude SENDERs.
.TP
.B \-N
(Default.)
Normal exit codes: 0 is the address is in any of the lists, 99 if not.
