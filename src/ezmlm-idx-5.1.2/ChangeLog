    Subject: ezmlm-idx-5.1.1 bug in ezmlm-send.c
    Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2007 10:04:08 -0500

    Howdy,
    
    Running ezmlm-0.53 patched with ezmlm-idx 5.1.1 came across a problem
    where the headers were trashed/garbled  when dir/listid exists.  Search
    a list archive to no luck on this problem.  So dug into the source code
    and found what appears to be a bug on line 481 where the wrong variable
    is being appended to the List-ID: header line and changing it gives the
    expected results.  Here is a patch:

    I have not been a subscriber to the list for several years so if there
    are any responses please include me in the cc.   BTW - 5.1.1 is a nice
    improvement over ezmlm-idx 0.40.  It is only getting better.  Thank
    you.

    Switch from using str_chr (and related) to byte_chr in ezmlm-make on
    stralloc strings, since such strings have externally bounded lengths
    instead of needing to rely on internal NUL byte bounding.

    That special case isn't covered for ezmlm-archive, which of course it

    invoked by messages from subscribers (so they won't be entered into the

    Message-ID: <20020215200912.M19928@lassie.disaster.nil>
    
    ezmlm-gate failed on my system.
    
    I checked the archive and found someone else has had the same problem:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ezmlm&m=96788355216423&w=2
    
    For whatever reason ezmlm-gate uses execvp("sh",...).
    I suppose that in my setup, where qmail is started under svscan, no
    environment is set and therefore execvp fails (didn't test it, though).
    
    I changed it to execv("/bin/sh", ...) - and guess - it works now. ;-)

    Well, it fixes qmqp relaying in idx-0.40 which simply didn't work.
    The main bug is in qmail.c, function qmail_open()
    (AFAIR it's this line:   for (i = 0; i + 1 < sa->len; i++) { ).
    I rearranged the code a little as well.
    
    Then I patched ezmlm-send:
    Changed "getconf_line(&qmqpservers,..." to "getconf(&qmqpservers,..."
    and removed the undocumented -Q switch, because moderated lists use
    ezmlm-moderate which calls ezmlm-send imlicetly with no chance to set
    this (useless) -Q switch.
    
    Note that ezmlm-send has been patched with some other patches before
    (ezmlm-idx.latest.patch, ezmlm-send.patch, ezmlm-idx.func.patch), so
    the line numbers may differ.
    
    All you have to do now is to put the IP number(s) of your relay servers
    in DIR/qmqpservers/0 (each line one IP). Install qmail+qmqpserver on the
    remote host(s) and of course tell this qmqpserver to accept mails from
    the ezmlm server (man tcpserver, man tcprules).
    
    The patch is attached.

    Well, well. ezmlm-send worked perfectly with this patch, but as when I
    put the patched ezmlm on the production server, I saw ezmlm-manage and
    ezmlm-store crashing. Arrgh!
    
    One little check was missing.

    The attached patch fixes a problem with ezmlm-send in ezmlm-idx (up to
    0.40 at least): it munges MIME messages which use the default type
    implicitly in the first MIME part.  (This is not an issue for stock
    ezmlm, which doesn't attempt to parse MIME parts AFAICT.)  The patch is
    applied after all the idx stuff is; I think it should be integrated into
    the -idx patches.  (Copyright is granted, of course.)
    
    See http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=9039 for a

    Subject: ezmlm-cgi/ezmlm-idx-0.40 security advisory
    
    Summary:
    ezmlm-cgi is part of the ezmlm-idx-0.40.tar.gz package and allows web
    access to mailing list archives. When ezmlm-cgi is installed SUID (user
    other than root), it can be used to execute arbitrary commands with the
    effective uid of the SUID user.
    
    Scope:
    Default installations of ezmlm-idx-0.40 are not vulnerable since
    ezmlm-cgi is not installed SUID by default. SUID root installations are
    not vulnerable since ezmlm-cgi uses a fixed configuration file location
    and drops privileges in this execution mode. SUID user (user != root)
    installations are discussed in the man page, but should be rare. Their
    vulnerability depends on group and world execute permissions of the
    ezmlm-cgi binary.
    
    Credit:
    Thanks vortfu (vort@wiretapped.net) for reporting this. I sincerely
    apologize for my initial somewhat obnoxious follow-up post.
    
    ezmlm-idx-0.40 is an add-on to Dan Bernstein's ezmlm-0.53 package. The
    responsibility for this flaw is entirely mine (Dan would never make a
    mistake like this).
    
    Details:
    ezmlm-cgi can be installed by a user to allow web access to that user's
    mailing list archives. It reads a config file from the working
    directory. The config file can contain a banner program name. This
    program is executed by ezmlm-cgi. ezmlm-cgi can be installed SUID root.
    In this case, ezmlm-cgi reads a config file from /etc, chdir/chroot to
    the list directory, drops root privileges, verifies this, then
    optionally executes a banner program.
    
    When installed SUID user != root, ezmlm-cgi behaves just as for normal
    installs. A user with execute permissions to the ezmlm-cgi binary can
    create his own config file directing ezmlm-cgi to execute an arbitrary
    program with the effective user id of the ezmlm-cgi binary.
    
    Fix:
    A patched version of ezmlm-cgi.c, ezmlm-cgi.1 (man page), as well as
    the patch (ezmlm-cgi.patch) are available from
    ftp://ftp.ezmlm.org/pub/patches/ and http://www.ezmlm.org/pub/patches/.
    This version removes the support for the execution of banner programs.
    HTML banners are still supported. The (small) patch can also be found
    below.
    
    Alternatively, assure that you have not installed ezmlm-cgi SUID user.
    
    Sincerely, Fred Lindberg
